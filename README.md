This sketch takes data from p5.js/ml5.js and sends it to the socket server. 
The video.html page communicates with the socket and takes the values generated by ml5.js

Note:
Please add videos into assets for this demo folder (1.mp4 and 2.mp4)

1. Add certificates in the root folder
```
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem
```

2. Run into terminal
```
node index.js
```

3. Check your ip and replace it into public/index.html and public/video.html
